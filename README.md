# ML-Task 2 (Titanic)

## machine learning project about titanic passangers . 

## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. We utilized the Titanic dataset to build and evaluate multiple models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using cross-validation.
The project implements a supervised learning flow on the Titanic dataset, which is divided into training and testing sets. The goal is to classify survival outcomes using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualized data to uncover patterns and relationships.
- Performed feature engineering to enhance data quality and relevance.

2. Model Training:

- Utilized algorithms like KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
- Applied 5-fold cross-validation with grid search for hyperparameter optimization.

3. Evaluation:

- Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
- Selected the best model based on cross-validation results and applied it to the test set.

## Tools and Techniques

- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Techniques: Supervised learning, feature engineering, cross-validation, grid search, etc'
